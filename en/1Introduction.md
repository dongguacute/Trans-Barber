## Introduction

Welcome to the Trans Barber project! This project is mainly to educate barbers about transgender people, with the goal of helping barbers better understand their clients' needs.

If you received this URL and **you are a barber**, it means your client **may be transgender**. If you are **not averse** to transgender people, please **continue reading this website**, as it will help you better understand your clients. If you feel **uncomfortable** with transgender people, then please **decline** this business, as it is best for both parties.

If it's the former, please jump to [What is Transgender](/en/2whatstrans.md)
