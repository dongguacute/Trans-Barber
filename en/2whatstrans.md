# What is Transgender

Introduction to the definition of transgender

## 💇‍♀️ What is "Transgender"?

"Transgender" (Transgender, abbreviated as "Trans") refers to a person's gender identity (the gender they identify with internally) being different from the gender assigned at birth.

Simply put, it's when someone feels in their heart that they are male, female, or some gender outside of those two, which may differ from what's written on their ID card.

### 🧠 For example:

- Some people are assigned "boy" at birth, but they've felt like a "girl" since childhood—she is a transgender woman.

- Others are assigned "girl" at birth, but feel they are actually a "boy"—he is a transgender man.

- There are also people who don't fully identify as "male" or "female"; they might call themselves non-binary.

## 💬 Why do barbers need to know?

Barbershops are places that transgender friends value greatly, because hairstyles are an important way to express gender identity.

If barbers can understand and respect their gender identity, it can make them feel safe and accepted.

## ✂️ Service Suggestions

1. Respect titles

If you're not sure whether they prefer to be called "sir" or "madam", you can politely ask: "How would you like me to address you?"

2. Respect privacy

If they haven't mentioned it, don't pry into questions about body, medical, or family matters.

3. Listen to needs

Transgender customers usually have clear goals for their appearance; listen to their ideas and design hairstyles according to their self-expression.

4. Maintain professionalism and friendliness

Treat them with the same respect, smile, and listening as any other customer, and they will feel warmth.

## Summary

If you think these are fine, you can reply to your client with an OK, or any response that indicates friendliness and no issues.
