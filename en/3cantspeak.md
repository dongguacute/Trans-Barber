# 💬 Things Barbers Should Never Say

——Respect every transgender customer, starting with words

In the barbershop, sometimes a casual remark can make transgender customers feel negated or hurt.

They are not "picky"; they have lived in an environment of constant misunderstanding, so they hope to be respected and treated as their true selves during haircuts.

Below are words you should **never say** ——even if you mean well.

## 🚫 1. "You don't suit a female (or male) hairstyle."

**Why not:** It sounds like denying their gender identity.

**Suggested saying:** "I can help you design a hairstyle that fits the vibe you're going for."

💡 Focus on **style and expression**, not gender.

---

## 🚫 2. "Were you originally a boy/girl?"

**Why not:** This is a very personal question that makes people feel invaded.

**Suggested action:** Don't ask such questions. Just serve according to how they want to look.

---

## 🚫 3. "Should I call you sir or madam?" (hesitantly or with a laugh)

**Why not:** The hesitation or curiosity in the tone can make them feel mocked or embarrassed.

**Suggested saying:** "How would you like me to address you?"

💡 Ask politely, without emotion, that's respect.

---

## 🚫 4. "This hairstyle won't be too feminine/manly for you?"

**Why not:** This is gender stereotypes, implying certain styles "don't suit" certain genders.

**Suggested saying:** "This hairstyle looks unique. Do you like this style?"

💡 Let the customer express themselves, don't define it for them.

---

## 🚫 5. "I can't tell you're transgender!"

**Why not:** Sometimes it might be a compliment, but sometimes it reminds them of being seen as their original gender, which can be uncomfortable.

**Suggested saying:** "This hairstyle really suits you!"

---

## 🚫 6. "Have you had surgery?" / "How long have you been on meds?"

**Why not:** These are very private personal questions unrelated to hair service.

**Suggested action:** Stick to topics related to hairstyle, style, and life interests, maintain professionalism.

## ✂️ Barber's Tips

1. **Respect titles:** Use the name or title they prefer.

2. **Respect privacy:** Don't ask about body, medical, or family matters.

3. **Listen to needs:** Focus on how they want to appear, not "how they should" look.

4. **Maintain professionalism and friendliness:** True respect, patience, and listening are the best inclusion.

## 💡 The most important point

Transgender customers come to the barbershop to "become themselves", not to be "reminded they are not someone".

As long as you truly respect their identity, listen to their needs attentively, they will feel warmth and security.
